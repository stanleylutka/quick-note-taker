# 📝 Quick Note Taker

Need a place to jot down your life-changing ideas, questionable grocery lists, or that one quote you swear you’ll remember? Here you go.

## 🚀 What Is This?

A simple web app that lets you:
- ✍️ Write a note
- 💾 Save it (it stays even if you refresh or close the browser)
- 🗑️ Delete it
- 🔁 Edit it
- 🌙 Toggle Dark Mode (because light mode burns)

All notes are saved in your browser using `localStorage`. No servers, no signups, no data mining — just good old-fashioned local hoarding.

## 🎨 Features

- Add, edit, and delete notes (because your thoughts evolve… or get worse)
- Dark mode toggle with ☀️/🌙 icons
- Automatically matches your system’s dark/light mode — we spy on nothing, but we still *know*
- Responsive layout that doesn't make your eyes cry

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Open it: [https://stanleylutka.github.io/quick-note-taker/](https://stanleylutka.github.io/quick-note-taker/)
2. Type something profound (or not).
3. Hit **Save Note**.
4. Boom — your note appears below with options to **Edit** or **Delete**.

## 💡 Tech Stack

- HTML (good old skeleton)
- CSS (because ugly apps are a crime)
- JavaScript (just enough to be clever, not cursed)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- Notes are stored in your browser — clear cache, lose notes. So maybe don’t write your will here.
- No backend. No cloud. No nonsense.
